# Rails Active Record/DB Programming Task

### In order to be considered for a Rails position, you must complete the following steps.
*Note: This task should be quick*

## Task

- Fork this repository (if you don't know how to do that, Google is your friend).
- You will need a postgres db created named: "ar_test"
- Navigate into the directory and run `ruby adv_ar.rb`
- Edit `DbTest#test_adv_scopes` so that each of the scopes in that class are correct (when editing them please optimize them and have them fire off as few database queries as you can)

## Once Complete
1. Commit and Push your code to your new repository
2. Send us a pull request, we will review your code and get back to you
